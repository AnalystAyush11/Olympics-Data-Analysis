# Olympics-Data-Analysis
In this project I analyzed Both Summer Olympics and Winter olympics dataset to find out Some Questions related to Gameby using Data Analytics Techniques like EDA .

Conducted an in-depth analysis of Olympic Games data, including athlete demographics, country performance, and event outcomes, using Python programming language and data visualization tools.

Identified trends and insights by analyzing data from multiple angles, including time series analysis, geographic analysis, and medal distribution analysis.
Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast medal counts for future Olympic Games, achieving high levels of accuracy.

Communicated findings and insights through data visualization tools, such as Tableau, to convey complex data insights.
